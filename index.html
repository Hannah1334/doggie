<h1>Appearance</h1>
Maya is small in stature, even in comparison to others of her age. She stands a whole inch below five feet in height, and that’s including the sort-of floppy ears that stick out from the top of her head. Her physique is more lanky than anything, with long thin limbs attached to a tiny petite body, just barely developing its feminine aspects as though she were some kind of major late-bloomer. The beginnings are there and evident, but miniscule in comparison to most. The girl only weighs roughly eighty-two pounds, allowing her to remain light and agile.
<br><br>
Her head is ovular in shape, while her facial features are very angular. A sharply cut chin and jawbone are awkwardly paired with fluffy cheeks still outgrowing their “baby fat” only contributing to her youthful adorable appearance. Wide eyes that shift color depending on the brightness of the lighting around her--amber in direct light, rosey red in the dark--sit as the crown jewels of her face, accented by long lashes, slender brows, a cute button nose, and soft pink lips hiding a mouth full of sharp teeth. Maya’s hair is intentionally kept cut short in a bob, and is a warm caramel blonde in color.
<br><br>
The Godling naturally possesses a few animalistic traits that are very obvious on her person, the primary being the dark brown furry dog ears that sit atop her small head. In addition a tiny fluffy tail, no longer than one foot, extends out from the base of her spine and is wagging more often than not. Her fingernails are just a couple centimeters longer, extending beyond her fingertips at a sharp point as though they were claws, and inside her mouth are an array of sharp teeth with very prominent canines.
<br><br>
<h1>Attire</h1>
A preference for reds, whites, and oranges is evident in the selection of her attire. She can always be found wearing something light, and loose fitting around the arms and legs to allow for as much free movement as possible while not slowing her with excess fabric that’ll only get in the way. Maya enjoys wearing shorts under cute dresses with fluffy flowing skirts, although her absolute favorite is the setup of robes that the priestesses and prophets that care for her father’s temple are required to dress in. Despite their formal appearance they are designed to allow the wearer to maneuver about freely while hunting or engaging in combat.
<br><br>
<h1>Personality</h1>
Just as any might expect of a young pup, Maya is full of energy. She is typically the kind of creature to have a positive outlook in most circumstances, even when she’s in a lot of danger. The young Godling can find fun in almost any activity, and loves to run, being as active as possible is what occupies most of her time and attention. She is also very friendly and can easily become attached to others, resulting in an intense loyalty canines are so infamous for. The embodiment of a young dog-like spirit with a human form can be a little overwhelming, but the only time she means anything true harm is if they clearly have ill will toward her and those she is devoted to.

<div id="tab2">
<img style="width:100%;height:100%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/AdkYSiC.jpg"/>
</div>

<div id="tab3">
<h1>Enhanced Physique</h1>
As a Goddess, Maya possesses natural traits that are enhanced beyond most humans and humanoid-like creatures, even within her own realm. She is certainly not advanced in everything, but excels at some key aspects thanks to her heritage and bloodline.
<br><br>
<b>Godlike Speed</b><br>
Agile and quick, speed is the natural talent she possesses that is greater above all of her others. Maya can maneuver herself at blinding speeds, and get to her own top speed threshold quicker than most--albeit the action of which is still a process that takes time just like it does for any other physical being. It is not only her body that works this way, but also her mind, which can process information at an impressive rate especially in situations where quick thinking is a necessary aspect of self preservation. Her subconscious muscle memory is also fast, not only in its ability to memorize new instincts, but also in its ability to react to situations and utilize those practiced movements and triggers
<br><br>
<b>Godlike Strength</b><br>
Despite her very small form, the Goddess of Nature is very strong. Her muscles are capable of exerting more, lifting more, and simply performing more, than other humans and humanoid creatures. They require a lot less mass to achieve the same effect, allowing her to remain lightweight and deceptively tiny in physique and stature, while producing results between double and triple what a strength-trained human is capable of. To make up for the strain of her organs, her skeleton is also greater in durability and density than what is typical, rivaling the strongest materials and minerals known to man without exceeding weight that would be normal for someone of her stature.
<br><br>
<b>Enhanced Senses</b><br>
Maya is a Wild-Born, a child conceived from one of her Father God’s beast aspects, which is far more animalistic in nature than human. Thanks to this fact she inherited some of the aspect’s superior senses as though her body belonged to that of a beast. Her ears and nose are as keen as that of a canine’s, which could be considered just as much a weakness as it is a strength. While this does allow her to trace scents on the wind, or hear noises most wouldn’t from much further distances--and even higher or lower frequencies--it also leaves her vulnerable to overstimulation. She does her best to use her magic in order to compensate for these flaws in her sensory, however there is only so much one can do to keep their ears and nose open when wary without leaving themselves vulnerable. In addition to this, her eyesight is like that of a hawk’s, allowing her to “zoom in” on far away details to see them more accurately than others would be able to when she wishes, aiding her vastly in her accuracy when attempting to aim at a target, as well as being able to recognize things from afar.
<br><br>
<b>Ferocity</b><br>
A basic part of nature, engraved into the very core behaviors of various creatures throughout, something all share regardless of race or culture of origin, is the need to survive. A fight or flight instinct is rooted among them all, but is especially strong in beasts with limited sentience. When threatened to a point of feeling as though she has been backed into a corner, Maya will reveal her “fight” instinct before “flight,” and her mind will revert to that of a primitive canine’s. Such ferocity will overcome her that in her desperation to get away she will first attack and establish herself as a dangerous threat. When this state overcomes her she runs on pure adrenaline, which is fueled by such extreme desperation that her other enhanced abilities are pushed to their absolute upper threshold limits, beyond that which she is capable of when simply existing. This is only a temporary state that lasts as long as she can go before physically draining herself into exhaustion, akin to a berserker mode, which cannot be accessed at will, or even instinctively right after it is first used, without plenty of rest and recuperation to make up for the energy lost.
<br><br>
<h1>Honed Skills</h1>
While the young Godling aged and grew older, she underwent a strict training regimen set in place by her father. The child’s Guardian, Khog, influenced most of her development. He taught her how to utilize her more primal and enhanced senses during combat scenarios, and put her in harsh situations where she would be forced to adapt to the environment and the nature of her attackers in order to either escape or take them down. With these methods, and by example, he helped her develop a unique fighting style for close quarters combat, where she uses her great speed and animal traits (such as teeth and claws) as weapons in addition to striking blows with foot and fist. 
<br><br>
When Rozborh found the time to retreat from the front lines and rest, he’d fill it with strict lessons of his own, instructing his daughter in her ability to manipulate nature itself and the living creations that surrounded her. He taught her the way of the hunter, how to track prey. A proper predator required patience and the ability to hide among their surroundings while still keeping an eye on their target. Striking from a distance was key, which led to her being forced down the path of archery. Maya was incredibly talented despite her rebellious distaste for the weapon-type, especially considering her enhanced vision and ability to aim with a level of accuracy that was beyond any human’s reach. To this day weapons such as bows and crossbows continue to be her expertise.

<h1>Weapons</h1>
<img style="width:100%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/GvS4S3Q.png"/>
<br><br>
<b>Vita Arcus</b><br>
A mystical longbow forged by the greatest smithees under both her mother and father’s rule. It is specifically designed to increase in size with its only wielder, growing as she does to remain equal in height to her. One might assume this to be quite the pain to carry around, however its very center has a built in mechanism that allows it to fold in half so it may be made more “compact,” making it much easier to transport the weapon especially if she is wearing it against her back. Now quiver or bowstring is necessary, the object operates entirely on the very intangible energy that is said to be the cause of passion and sentience within living beings, the aspects of the soul that make life worth living to the individual and gives them the drive to continue the cycle of birth and death that is a part of nature itself. It is often referred to as “life energy” or “nature force.”
<br>
This bow channels that mythical energy into solid form, providing its own source of arrows and string from its wielder’s own mana. The arrows she creates with it have two very specific modes--of which only one can be used on a single arrow at a time, she cannot have an arrow shift between modes once it has been fired--the first and primary behaving like a typical solid. As a magical substance they have the ability to pierce into or through all natural materials in existence (natural meaning they were crafted using elements of nature or earth, whether it be metals that the ecosystem creates itself naturally, or fibers woven together from materials found in/on plants and animals) but are weaker to that which is completely “man-made” or unnatural. The second mode allows them to achieve a ghost-like state which allows them to phase through solids as though intangible, flesh and bodies included, although when they are set to this they can only do damage to the spirit/soul of a being.
<br><br>
<h1>Items</h1>
<b>Binding Band</b><br>
The only item Maya possesses that was directly made from only her mother’s hands. It is a ring of binding, a constant reminder that she is already spoken for, trapped in an arranged marriage to a complete stranger. 
<img align="right" style="height:30%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/83r1ORy.png"/>
She wears it loyally, but has mixed feelings about its purpose around her finger. Its origin and the obvious care put into the craftsmanship makes it impossible not to treasure, yet it feels like another shackle around her wrists, inevitably force-tying her to another individual. It is expected to someday graduate from promise ring to wedding ring, although the physical object itself will never be removed or changed, only the symbolism behind its presence on her hand.
<br><br>
<b>Wild Blessing</b><br>
If the promise ring can be considered an heirloom from the girl’s mother, then this piece of simple jewelry is most certainly the one from her father. 
<img align="left" style="height:30%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/Oq8xsjK.png"/>
It carries no mythical traits, its only symbolism being his mark of ownership on her. In a way the object can be worn with pride, as if to say Rozborh himself finds her worthy of being called his child, but the amount of expectation and responsibility that comes with it weighs very heavily on the simple chain around her neck. The charm itself is nothing more than a bronzed leaf and an emerald gem that dangles behind it near its center. Legend says that the emerald is the “Eye of the Wild” and allows the father to communicate with his beloved daughter, but this is nothing more than a rumor.

<div id="tab8">
<img style="width:100%;height:100%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/dryoARi.jpg"/>
</div>

<div id="tab9">
<h1>The Guardian</h1>
<img align="left" style="height:45%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/6LrwJgL.png"/>
In the realm of Rozborh’s rule, the food chain often determines a creature’s likelihood for survival. Those who require nutrients and sustenance from lesser beasts are encouraged to hunt, and the most successful hunters are blessed by their god regardless of race. Khog never desired such a title, nor did he seek blessings and fame. His loyalty to Rozborh was unmatched, and eventually the Collective grew fond of the insistent pup who never seemed content leaving his side, but was always happy to follow his orders. This massive mutt’s skills were certainly better than average, and invaluable, putting his master in a tough position. If the undeniably talented beast’s desire was to serve, then he would be the symbol of champions. Fame and glory now meant a chance to call the Knight of the Hunter their partner, who feared nothing and was loyal with such ferocity if they worked together nothing could stand in their way. Eventually it came to pass that Rozborh’s daughter was in desperate need of a Guardian, so for the sake of keeping face his trusted Knight was given the title of Great General and tasked with overseeing her wellbeing throughout her adventures. Khog adores the child and loves her as if she were his own pup.
<br><br>
<h1>Arranged Betrothed</h1>
<img align="right" style="height:50%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/x2tiUxU.png"/>
As to be expected from a birth that was intended only for the possibility of either contributing to the prophecy, or developing proud powerful warriors to aid himself and his colleagues on the battlefield, a marriage was arranged for her since her birth. The Wild Collective, Rozborh, believed himself to be superior to his god-kin, and in his pride desired his offspring to produce more offspring who were purely his own descendants, because in his mind it was the only way to keep a bloodline of strong warriors and hunters alive. These ideals would be forced on his children, who were separated and never allowed to know of each other until the time was right. His son, Petrebris, was born first between the two, and when his element manifested to take after his carefully selected mother, he was left in her hands to be raised proper. A second attempt at a child was made, and when the production of a female baby was proven successful she was taken into her father’s care. From the moment it was confirmed that the second-born would be a daughter her fate as Petrebris’ eventual bride was sealed. Both would grow up knowing their partners were already chosen, though who they were would remain a mystery until Fate brought them together. Some might rightfully turn their nose up, or be disgusted by the act of forcing one’s own children to wed one another, however it is important to remember that among gods and beasts such actions are not very rare.
<br>

<br><br>
<h1>Father God</h1>
<p align="center"><img style="height:40%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/WjarObZ.jpg"/></p>
The God of the Wild Hunt may have been a singular individual at one point in time, however, he eventually used his powers to turn himself into a hivemind known as the Wild Collective. He became It, an entity that acted as one with a colossal amount of spirits and souls from all known beings within his domain that had long since passed on whether fallen on the battlefield or died of natural causes. No two souls are the same, but each allows him to not only take on the traits that they had in life but also manifest into any tangible forms they once had that he desires to utilize. Technically they are many, but do not possess their own personality traits nor any individuality once they become part of Rozborh. In short he is quite a powerful god, who relies on many, yet has little to no humility to show for it. He believes his own methods to be above all others, and thinks all other Godlings are unworthy of the presence of his offspring. Even though he only had them to breed warriors, the Wild Collective is still quite fond of his two children. The majority of his free time is spent with his daughter, who he trains in the art of The Hunt and passes on his knowledge and skill with the manipulation of Nature she inherited from him.
